# warezTerminal
A C++ project I'm working on

I will release pre-compiled binaries soon.

To compile from source follow instructions below
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zoofyiscool/warezTerminal.git
```
```
$ make
```
Binary should be in the build folder, if you want to install globally type below as **root**
```
$ make install
```
